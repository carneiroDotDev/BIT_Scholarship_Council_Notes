# Post a Project on Github
**Project_3 contains tips on how to pass the github project once and for all**
To pass the Github project, you must take the following into consideration
* Adding a .gitignore to the project
    * A .gitignore file has been added to the repo already, you just need to add the .csv files to avoid showing your data files e.g 
    chicago.csv or *.csv (to add all .csv files) whichever works for you. *also remember that each file must start in a new line*
* Using the [Udacity](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) commit style format is also very important for passing this project
* you can use "git checkout -b documentation", this creates a new branch and also sets it as current branch
* Remember to fill in every step in the template provided as not to forget codes or commit messages used during the project
* Remember to add the link to your repo in the two places the link was requested in the template
**With these and other things learned in the course, you should be very good to go :thumbsup :smiley
